## Protocol Specification
This document describes the application-layer communication protocol for data exchange between the sensor/actuator nodes and the control panel nodes.

## Terminology
- **Sensor :** In the context of an IoT system, a sensor gathers data from the environment/physical world, and then the real world phenomena gets converted into digital signals.
- **Actuator :** The actuator is the component of the system that takes the digital signals and converts them into physical actions or changes the environment.
    We can think of the sensors as the "eyes and ears" of the system, while the actuators are the "hands and feet".
- **Control-panel nodes** :
- **Sensor/Actuator nodes** :
