## The SSP Protocol Specification
### **SSP, short for Six-Seven Protocol**
This document describes the Six-Seven Protocol, an application-layer communication protocol for data exchange between the sensor/actuator nodes and the control panel nodes.

## Terminology
- **Sensor :** In the context of an IoT system, a sensor gathers data from the environment/physical world, and then the real world phenomena gets converted into digital signals.
- **Actuator :** The actuator is the component of the system that takes the digital signals and converts them into physical actions or changes the environment.

    We can think of the sensors as the "eyes and ears" of the system, while the actuators are the "hands and feet".
- **Control-panel nodes** :
- **Sensor/Actuator nodes** :

| Underlying Transport             | TCP                                                                                                                       | We use TCP as the underlying transport layer in our protocol. This is mainly because we want the protocol to be reliable, not to mention that the accuracy matters more than the speed.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Port Number                      | 6767                                                                                                                      | This port number is not used by any other well known protocols: [List of TCP and UDP port numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers). In other words, this port number is practical since it avoids conflicts with the other port numbers. We chose this port number for its simplicity and memorability.                    |
| Architecture                     | One central server, which can handle multiple control panel clients. Sensor & actuator nodes are simulated in the server. | Only one server is specified, and, although it is possible to set up multiple servers and machines, we've limited ourselves to one server only for testing, debugging and development purposes. The reason we simulate the sensor / actuator nodes is because we wanted to focus on the protocol logic, and not worry about external real life components. |
| Information Flow                 | Full duplex                                                                                                               | TCP is full duplex, but our application-layer is rather simple: the control panel sends a request, and waits for a corresponding reply. This fits the assignment requirements, as well as keeping the client logic simple.                                                                                                                                 |
| Protocol Type                    | Connection-oriented                                                                                                       | The connections are TCP-sockets. The server keeps the state (greenhouse list, actuators, sensors) across messages. This is necessary for retrieving the environment data.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
