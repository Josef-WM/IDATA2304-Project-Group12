# IDATA2304-Project-Group12

To run the project, change directory into the StudentMadeGadgets
folder where the pom.xml file is located. Then, run the command:

```shell
mvn exec:java
```

Note that it is possible to run the Main class directly from an IDE
such as IntelliJ IDEA, but in these cases the ansi escape codes does
not always get interpreted correctly. (We use the ansi escape codes
to do things such as clear the screen and change text colours.)
